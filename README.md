RESTfulExample
==============

These are examples of REST that are based off the Jersey book from:
http://jersey.java.net/nonav/documentation/latest/

The examples use maven-jetty-plugin to run an embedded Jetty server to run the server through

```
cd war
mvn jetty:run
```

To get to the example REST endpoints see the source file documentation.
